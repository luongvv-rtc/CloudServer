# CloudServer
Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted file-sharing and collaboration platform that allows users to store, manage, and share files securely. It offers a range of functionalities similar to popular cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive but with the added advantage of giving users complete control over their data and privacy.
